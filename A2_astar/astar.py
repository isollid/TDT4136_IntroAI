The attach-and-evaluate routine simply attaches a child node to a node that is now considered its best parent

The propagation of path improvements recurses through the children and possibly many other descendants.
Some children may not have had P as their best parent. If the updates to g(P) do not make P the best
parent for a given child, then the propagation ceases along that child's portion of the search graph. However,
if any child can improve its own g value due to the change in g(P), then that child will have P as its best
parent and must propagate the improvement in g further, to its own children. This insures that all nodes
in the search graph are always aware of their current best parent and their current best g value, given the
information that has been uncovered by the search algorithm up to that point in time. The propagation of
these updates can eventually aect nodes on OPEN, thus in
uencing the order in which nodes get popped,
and hence the direction of search.
